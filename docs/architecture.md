## Core Components

The framework consists of several core components that work together to provide a complete deep learning ecosystem:

1. **Tensor System**: Provides data structures and operations for multi-dimensional arrays
2. **Computation Graph**: Enables automatic differentiation and optimization
3. **Neural Network Modules**: Implements common neural network layers and architectures
4. **Backends**: Handles the actual computations on different hardware
5. **I/O System**: Manages loading and saving models and data

## Tensor System

The tensor system is the foundation of SK-AI-Net, providing the basic data structures and operations for deep learning.

- **Shape**: Represents the dimensions of a tensor
- **Tensor Implementations**: Different implementations for different data types and storage strategies
- **Tensor Operations**: Mathematical operations like addition, multiplication, and matrix multiplication

## Computation Graph

The computation graph enables automatic differentiation by representing computations as a directed graph.

```
+------------------+
|   ComputeNode    |
+------------------+
|   - inputs       |
|   - evaluate()   |
+------------------+
        ^
        |
+-------+--------+-------------+-------------+
|                |             |             |
+------------+   |    +----------------+     |
| ValueNode  |   |    |  MultiplyNode  |     |
+------------+   |    +----------------+     |
                 |                           |
        +-----------------+        +------------------+
        |    AddNode      |        | ActivationNode   |
        +-----------------+        +------------------+
```

Key components:
- **ComputeNode**: Base class for all nodes in the computation graph
- **ValueNode**: Leaf node that holds a constant value
- **Operation Nodes**: Nodes that perform operations on their inputs
- **Expression**: Wrapper around a computation node that provides a fluent API

## Neural Network Modules

The neural network modules provide high-level abstractions for building neural networks.

```

+------------------+
|   - forward()    |
+------------------+
        ^

## Backends

The backends handle the actual computations on different hardware platforms.

## I/O System

The I/O system manages loading and saving models and data.

## Design Principles

SK-AI-Net is built on several key design principles:

1. **Modularity**: Components are designed to be independent and reusable
2. **Extensibility**: The framework is easy to extend with new functionality
3. **Type Safety**: Kotlin's type system is leveraged to catch errors at compile time
4. **Performance**: Critical operations are optimized for performance
5. **Multiplatform**: The framework works across different platforms (JVM, JS, Native)
6. **Interoperability**: Easy integration with other libraries and frameworks

These principles guide the development of SK-AI-Net and ensure that it remains a flexible, powerful tool for deep learning in Kotlin.
